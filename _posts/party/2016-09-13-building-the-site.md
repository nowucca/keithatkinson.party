So we came up with this idea for a *simple* website for the party.  After hunting for a site name, we decided that we should get keithatkinson.party, mainly because .party is cool and nothing else seemed more obvious.
Over the next few weeks we are looking to pare down the content on this site to the bare minimum.  The concept right now is some information, some blog posts and a "this is Your Life" section where you can submit stories
and hopefully photos of Keith, some of which can be shared at the party.
