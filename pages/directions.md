## Directions from Brisbane

Take exit 82 (Robina Town Centre, Somerset Drive) left off the highway, keep in right lane, turn right at the lights to cross the highway, straight at the first roundabout, then turn right at the second roundabout (follow down Somerset Drive). \[Garage on left, at this point\].

Follow Somerset Drive. Drive past school and school cricket grounds and turn sharp left into Bonogin Road at the top of the gentle hill (before the third set of lights on the main road).

Follow Bonogin Road for about 8.5 km. After a couple of roundabouts in the middle of the hills, watch out for a Café/General Store on your right (there is only one and you can't miss it).

Turn the first left into Gardenia Drive, then third on your right is Kauri Court. Up the hill, on your right is 21.
